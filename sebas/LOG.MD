# Changelog

Inspired by [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), [semantic vesioning](https://semver.org/), [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) and my own personal logs, this document will describe all the changes done to the project *and* some thoughts and musings that went through my head whilst working on this.

The most recent entry will be at the top.

Entry types:

* Versions: Usual changelog entries
* Development sessions: Freeform entries made as I worked.

## Development session log #2

Just chilling and coding, listening to Cesária Évora. I've got to find a way for functions that return the same type of object to be typed correctly.

Well, this is not much, but it's progress, I guess.

## Development session log #1
20:56 September 1st, 2022

Let's start this thing. I'm feeling alright. I haven't managed to overcome the "activation energy" needed to work on anything for quite a long time. I've stopped talking to people I cared about for no reason in particular and just can't get myself to go back and do as little as just greeting them, so it's heartening to be finally working on something again.

I've written down the essential components of the system on the Wiki yesterday. Time to begin implementing them on Scala.

Currently listening to a shuffled mix of Os Mutantes' music and being occasionally distracted by Discord.

Upon implementing the core features and beginning work on the CoreMovement example, I've decided what the first module will be: abstracting/defining effects that affect the agent that caused them (e.g. moving).

Eh, that's enough thinking for today.
